                    I have been working with Megan for over a year now with the purpose of up leveling my overall health and fitness.
                    It has been a pleasure to learn from one who walks her talk.
                    I have looked up to Megan from the beginning of our appointments based on her own self-care and her educational background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been thru a few medical procedures that required extra attention regarding pre-surgery and recovery.  Meganâ€™s knowledge and expertise expedited those processes.
                    Her detail in reading blood labs to support her recommendations are extensive through diet and supplementation. Very impressive!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    There has been a ripple effect of her counsel to my friends and family that now work with her.  I am beyond grateful for the outcomes I practice each day!
                    At seventy years of age, I have up leveled my fitness and health over this past year.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you, Megan!
